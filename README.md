The main research aims of this study are: 1) to estimate daily WBGT values across China for the warm season (May-September) from 1980 to 2019 and analyse the contribution of key meteorological factors to the overall WBGT values; 2) to analyse heatwave events and quantify the variations in frequency, duration, and intensity over the research period; 3) to assess heatwave-related mortality risk using WBGT and a fixed-effects panel model, providing a more accurate evaluation of health risks associated with heatwave exposure across China.![00 区位图-WBGT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1aa6d26-bf9f-4438-b61f-ee9d7955ded3)
