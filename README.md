Despite the increasing attention to heat-related health risks, several limitations remain in the existing literature. Many studies either rely on temperature alone or use simplified thermal indices that may underestimate human-perceived heat stress. In addition, traditional linear regression models may fail to fully capture the complex, nonlinear relationship between population heatwave exposure and health outcomes. This study attempts to fill these gaps by (1) using WBGT as a comprehensive index of human thermal stress, (2) quantifying a long-term heatwave and population exposure spatiotemporal trend from 1980 to 2019 across China, and (3) applying GAM to flexibly capture the nonlinear relationship between heatwave exposure and mortality. These contributions collectively enhance the empirical understanding of heatwave impacts on human health and support the development of adaptive public health strategies.
